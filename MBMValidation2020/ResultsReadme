MBM VALIDATION RESULTS 

Thank you for your interest in our MBM. The results of our experiments are found in the zip files "modeling_results" and “interpretation_results”. The graded results are found in the corresponding excel files. Each excel has 19 sheets that contain the rubrics used to score each experiment and their analysis. All results are anonymous. The sheets are indexed as follows:

1.	Overall Grades: This sheet has all the scores of the experiment along with the histograms and analysis performed.
2.	Sheet 1 to 18: Each sheet contains the rubric used to score the corresponding experiment.
